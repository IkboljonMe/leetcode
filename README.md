# MY [LEETCODE](https://leetcode.com/ikboljonme/) SOLUTIONS

This repo contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, along with explanations and Jest test cases.

## Problem Solutions

For each problem, you can find a JavaScript file containing my solution and a link to an explanation of the code. I have tried to write clear and concise code that is easy to understand, and I have provided explanations to help you understand my thought process and approach to the problem.

## Jest Testcases

To ensure the correctness of my solutions, I have included Jest test cases for each problem. These tests cover various edge cases and input scenarios to help verify that my solution is working correctly.

## Usage

Before running the tests, make sure to download all the required packages by running **npm install** command in the terminal.

```
npm install
```

To run all the Jest test cases, simply run **npm test** in the terminal. This will execute all the tests in the repository.

```
npm test
```

If you want to run tests for a specific problem, you can specify the file path of the test using the --PATH option. For example, to run tests for a problem located in the problems/foo.js file, **run npm test -- problems/foo.test.js**.

```
npm test -- problems/foo.test.js
```
